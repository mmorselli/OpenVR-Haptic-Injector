# OpenVR Haptic Injector

prototype ( in a very preliminary state) of a program that intercepts OpenVR haptic events and transforms them into low frequency sinusoidal signals sent to a secondary sound card

Suitable for controlling haptic devices based on bass shakers / body shakers, such as haptic suits or simulator rigs
